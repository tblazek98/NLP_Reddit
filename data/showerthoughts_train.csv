The baby will be kept alive through machinery, and will have exactly the same personality as Person A, in 30 years/ once the video ends( it could be possible to speed this video up and let the Baby gain the Personality a little faster), since the baby has “lived“ through Person As life. After all this the only question should be, how to integrate this Baby back into our own world, which will be discussed, once we are able to to this.You might think that the Baby won’t have exactly the same Personality as Person A since Baby and Person A are two different human beings, but since the Baby has been living only for a second(preferably) and hasn’t been influenced by the world, not even one bit, it should in theory be possible to shape its Personality, through the Video/ Person As life.The Baby also wouldn’t think that what it is watching, isn’t its life, since if all the life experiences are the same, the Personality will be shaped the same way at any point in time, it will be a 100% chance that every choice Person A had felled in its life, would also be chosen by the Baby, since the Baby hasn’t had any other experience in life except what Person A has experienced in its life. Also because of that the Baby should actually think about exactly the same things as Person A while living through every situation in Person As 30 Year long lifespan.
